      ### Version 2 Multiple Device - *12 Dec 2023*
      - Fixed: iOS showing `Failed to load attachment`
      - Refactor: Build payload in templates
      - Deprecated: `📲 Notification Strategy` due to refactor.
      - Deprecated: `📲 Service to notify` due to refactor.
      - Added: Support for [fields](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/script/#fields)
        - Added: `🏷️ Title` field
        - Added: `💬 Message` field
        - Added: `🏷️ Subtitle` field
        - Added: `📸 Attachment: Camera Entity: Camera Entity` field
        - Added: Options show/hide fields
        - Added: `⌛️ Enable Timeout` and `⌛️ Enable Timeout Action(s)` fields.
      - Added: [`🚘 Show on Android Auto`](https://companion.home-assistant.io/docs/notifications/notifications-basic?_highlight=car_ui#android-auto-visibility) option.
      - Added: `⌛️ Enable Timeout Action(s)` option and field.

      > Notes:
      >  - When enabling boolean fields with value of false, be sure to toggle them to true once, and then to false.

    ### Known Issues

      <details>
      <summary>Expand/collapse known issues</summary>

      - In some cases, iOS does not seem to play well with newer features. 
        If that happens to you, you can [check out older releases here](https://github.com/samuelthng/t-house-blueprints/releases).

      - In some cases, some setups have difficulty receiving events from the device.
        When this happens, no actions will be performed by Home Assistant.

        You can test this:
          - Navigate to Developer Tools → Events
          - Listen to event: `mobile_app_notification_action`
          - Trigger a notification to your device by running the script
          - Select an action option

        If you do not see an event appearing in the Events page, this could be the issue.
        You might want to check the [troubleshooting documents](https://companion.home-assistant.io/docs/troubleshooting/faqs), or check your network configuration to resolve the issue.

    ### FAQ

      <details>
      <summary>Expand/collapse FAQ</summary>

      - **_Will you add sending notifications to multiple devices?_**
        Sadly, no. It is possible to send notifications to multiple devices, however, it will not work as well with the timeout feature and notifications clearing at this time.

        I might revisit it in future, but not at this time.

      - **_Why can't I see my devices or notify service?_**
        You might want to check if troubleshooting steps provided by the [Home Assistant Companion app documentation](https://companion.home-assistant.io/docs/troubleshooting/faqs) may be able to help.

      - **_Why do I keep receiving notifications incessantly?_**
        Check your scripts and automation, there might be a logical loop going on that's triggering the notification over and over again. If you need further help, feel free to drop by the [main post](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/notifications-actionable-mobile-notifications-script-with-optional-timeout-feature-and-camera-snapshots-works-with-ios-android/) and share your automation and scripts yamls.

        <details>
            <summary>❔ What is this?</summary>

          This option is only applicable to Android due to technical limitations. 
                    
          The android app can't sending events and open links on the device at the same time, using the same option.

          As such, options on the android app can only be either a link, or an action on Home Assistant. Not both.

          This is due to:

          - The lack of events being sent when URI options are fired.
          - The requirement to set the `action` parameter to `"URI"`.
